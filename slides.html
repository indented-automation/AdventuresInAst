# Adventures in AST

# What is AST

A representation of the source code.

"A tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node denotes a construct occurring in the source code."

---

# What is Static Analysis

The method of examining source code without execution.

---

# PSParser and Language.Parser

PowerShell providers two different classes for analysing source code.

 - PSParser was introduced with PowerShell 2.
 - Language.Parser (and AST in general) was introduced with PowerShell 3.

---

# AST includes

All executed elements of the source code which are considered programming structures.

Comments and white space are not included. End of line continuation characters are not included.

---

# Accessing the AST

All script blocks have an AST property.
```powershell
$scriptBlock = {
    Write-Host 'Hello world'
}
$scriptBlock.Ast
```

---

# AST from a string

Strings can be parsed into AST using the ParseInput static method.
```powershell
$script = "Write-Host 'Hello world'"
$tokens = @()
$errors = @()
[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseInput(
    $script,
    [Ref]$tokens,
    [Ref]$errors
)
```

---

# AST from a file

Files can be parsed into AST using the ParseFile static method.
```powershell
Set-Content -Path script.ps1 -Value "Write-Host 'Hello world'"
$tokens = @()
$errors = @()
[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile(
    (Get-Item script.ps1).FullName,
    [Ref]$tokens,
    [Ref]$errors
)
```

---

# ParseInput: fileName argument

ParseInput has a second overload that accepts both a file name and a string representing the script. The string is used as content, the file name is added to Extent information (and is not read).
```powershell
$script = "Write-Host 'Hello world'"
Set-Content -Path script.ps1 -Value "Write-Host 'Goodbye'"
$tokens = @()
$errors = @()
$ast = [System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseInput(
    $script,
    (Get-Item script.ps1).FullName,
    [Ref]$tokens,
    [Ref]$errors
)
$ast.Extent.Text         # Taken from the variable, $script
$ast.Extent.File         # Just a path
Get-Content script.ps1   # The mis-matched content of the file
```
The file path does not need to exist.

---

# Getting at comments

Comments are available by tokenizing a script.

Using the script below:

```powershell
$script = "
   # This is a comment
   Write-Host 'Hello world'
"
```

---

# With PSParser

PSParser can tokenize a script.
```powershell
$script = "
   # This is a comment
   Write-Host 'Hello world'
"
$errors = @()
$tokens = [System.Management.Automation.PSParser]::Tokenize(
    $script,
    [Ref]$errors
)
$tokens[1]
```
Tokens are of type System.Management.Automation.PSToken.

---

# With Language.Parser

Language.Parser can tokenize a script.
```powershell
$script = "
   # This is a comment
   Write-Host 'Hello world'
"
$errors = @()
$tokens = @()
[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseInput(
    $script,
    [Ref]$tokens,
    [Ref]$errors
)
$tokens[1]
```
Tokens are of type System.Management.Automation.Language.Token.

The Extent property holds position information.

---

# Syntax testing with ParseInput

A basic syntax test can be performed by exploring errors.

```powershell
$script = '
    if ($value -eq $true)) {
        Set-Something
    }
'

$errors = @()
$tokens = @()
$ast = [System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseInput(
    $script,
    [Ref]$tokens,
    [Ref]$errors
)
$errors
```

---

# AST types

Each node in the AST has a specific AST class type. The AST types are in the System.Management.Automation.Language namespace. The AST types can be listed:
```powershell
[PowerShell].Assembly.GetTypes().Where{
    $_.IsPublic -and 
    $_.IsSubclassOf([System.Management.Automation.Language.Ast])
}
```

---

# Finding the AST type name

A tree can be explored by walking through the properties.
```powershell
$scriptBlock = {
    'Hello world' | Write-Host
}
$scriptBlock.Ast.EndBlock.Statements.PipelineElements
```
In the snippet above, the following are true:

 - "'Hello world' | Write-Host" is a StatementAst (the first in an array)
 - "'Hello world'" and "Write-Host" are Pipeline Elements (an array of Ast nodes)
 - "'Hello world'" is a CommandExpressionAst containing a StringConstantExpressionAst
 - "Write-Host" is a CommandAst

---

# An AST can be searched

Two methods are exposed to search an AST:

 - Find
 - FindAll

Find returns the first match. FindAll returns all matches. The methods are presented on all AST nodes.

Both methods take the same arguments. A predicate and a boolean value.
```powershell
{}.Ast.Find.OverloadDefinitions
```
```powershell
{}.Ast.FindAll.OverloadDefinitions
```
The predicate is a logic statement which tests the value of each node in the tree. An assertion about the state of a thing.

---

# Writing a predicate

The predicate is defined as a script block. A single argument is passed. 
```powershell
$predicate = { $args[0] -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandAst] }
{ Write-Host 'Hello world' }.Ast.Find(
    $predicate,
    $true
)
```
The predicate may declare a param block to give a name to $args[0].
```powershell
$predicate = {
    param (
        $ast
    )
    
    $ast -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandAst]
}

{ Write-Host 'Hello world' }.Ast.Find(
    $predicate,
    $true
)
```

---

# Using Find

Find returns the first match.
```powershell
$predicate = {
    param (
        $ast
    )
    
    $ast -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandAst]
}

{
    Write-Host 'Hello world'
    Get-Command Write-Host
}.Ast.Find(
    $predicate,
    $true
)
```

---

# Using FindAll

FindAll returns all matches.
```powershell
$predicate = {
    param (
        $ast
    )
    
    $ast -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandAst]
}

{
    Write-Host 'Hello world'
    Get-Command Write-Host
}.Ast.FindAll(
    $predicate,
    $true
)
```

---

# Search scope

The boolean value is used to indicate a search should include nested script blocks.

When false, the predicate will find one Write-Host command.

```powershell
$predicate = { param ( $ast ) $ast -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandAst] }

{
    Write-Host 'Hello world'
    # This is a nested script block
    {
        Write-Host 'Hello again'
    }
}.Ast.FindAll(
    $predicate,
    $false
)
```

---

# What is a nested script block

A nested script block will include any passed as arguments. Including arguments for:

 - ForEach-Object
 - Where-Object
 - Invoke-Command

---

# Nested script block with ForEach-Object

```powershell
$predicate = { param ( $ast ) $ast -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandAst] }
{
    1..10 | ForEach-Object {
        Write-Host 'Hello world'
    }
}.Ast.FindAll(
    $predicate,
    $false
)
```

---

# Language keywords

The body of if, foreach, while, and other language keywords are not nested script blocks.
```powershell
$predicate = { param ( $ast ) $ast -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandAst] }
{
    foreach ($i in 1..10) {
        Write-Host 'Hello world'
    }
}.Ast.FindAll(
    $predicate,
    $false
)
```

---

# Implementing a search for single character variables

Variables named after a single character might be considered a bad practice.

To create the predicate the problem can be explored.

```powershell
{ $a = 'something' }.Ast.EndBlock.Statements[0].GetType()
```

---

# Creating the search

```powershell
$script = {
    $a = Get-Something
    foreach ($x in $a) {
        Set-Something
    }
    for ($i = 0; $i -lt 10; $i += 2) {
        $i
    }
}
$predicate = {
    param ( $ast )

    $ast -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.AssignmentStatementAst] -and
    $ast.Left.VariablePath.UserPath.Length -eq 1
}
$script.Ast.FindAll($predicate, $true)
```

---

# Allowing counters

```powershell
$script = {
    $a = Get-Something
    foreach ($x in $a) {
        Set-Something
    }
    for ($i = 0; $i -lt 10; $i += 2) {
        $i
    }
}
$predicate = {
    param ( $ast )

    $ast -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.AssignmentStatementAst] -and
    $ast.Left.VariablePath.UserPath.Length -eq 1 -and
    -not (
        $ast.Right -is [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandExpressionAst] -and
        $ast.Right.Expression.StaticType.Name -match '^U?Int'
    )
}
$script.Ast.FindAll($predicate, $true)
```

# PS Script Analyzer

PS script analyzer allows rules to be defined either based on the AST, or on Tokens.

Script analyzer can consume custom rules from a PowerShell module.

PS script analyzer has some example community rules:

[github/powershell/ScriptAnalyzer: CommunityAnalyzerRules.psm1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/e22d1b47c1fc46837296d29983e8a902c4c3bdeb/Tests/Engine/CommunityAnalyzerRules)

---

# Rule discovery

Script analyzer will consider a function to be a rule when:

 - The function is exported by a module
 - The name of the first parameter for the function ends with:
    - ast for rules based on AST
    - token for rules based on tokens
 - Parameters ending AST must define an AST type

If the parameter name ends with token, Script Analyzer will pass the script as an array of tokens (System.Management.Automation.Language.Token).

---

# Parameter discovery

From [github/powershell/ScriptAnalyzer: ScriptAnalyzer.cs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/e22d1b47c1fc46837296d29983e8a902c4c3bdeb/Engine/ScriptAnalyzer.cs#L1036)
```cs
try
{
    param = funcInfo.Parameters.Values.First<ParameterMetadata>(item => 
        item.Name.EndsWith("ast", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
        item.Name.EndsWith("token", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase
    ));
}
catch
{
}
```

---

# Rule description

If the function has help, the descripton is read.

An empty rule.
```powershell
Set-Content Rules.psm1 -Value '
function MyRule {
    <#
    .DESCRIPTION
        This is the rule description.
    #>

    param (
        [System.Management.Automation.Language.ScriptBlockAst]$someAst
    )
}'

Get-ScriptAnalyzerRule -CustomRulePath Rules.psm1
```

---

# Building rules

Script Analyzer rules should return one or more instances of:

 - Microsoft.Windows.Powershell.ScriptAnalyzer.Generic.DiagnosticRecord

When creating a diagnostic record, RuleName and Message must be set. Extent should be set.

---

# Building AST based rules

The AST type a rule accepts should represent the level a diagnostic record should be generated.

AST types can be considered to be hierarchical. In a module file the following structure might be seen.

- ScriptBlockAst - Widest scope available
    - FunctionDefinitionAst
        - ScriptBlockAst
            - ParamBlockAst
            - NamedBlockAst
                - StatementAst
                    - PipelineAst
                        - CommandAst

If an error is caused by a CommandAst and is to be flagged for a function, the rule should accept FunctionDefinitionAst.

---

# A simple rule

Create a diagnostic message for each instance of Write-Host.

```powershell
@'
function StopUsingWriteHost {
    <#
    .DESCRIPTION
        Do not use Write-Host.
    #>

    param (
        [System.Management.Automation.Language.CommandAst]$someAst
    )

    if ($someAst.GetCommandName() -eq 'Write-Host') {
        [Microsoft.Windows.Powershell.ScriptAnalyzer.Generic.DiagnosticRecord]@{
            RuleName             = $myinvocation.InvocationName
            Message              = 'Please do not use Write-Host'
            Extent               = $someAst.Extent
        }
    }
}
'@ | Set-Content Rules.psm1
```

---

# Testing the AST based rule

```powershell
$script = '
Write-Host "Oh, the grand old duke of york;"
Write-Host "He had ten thousand men;"
Write-Host "He marched them up to the top of the hill,"
Write-Host "and he marched them down again."
'

Import-Module PSScriptAnalyzer

Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -ScriptDefinition $script -CustomRulePath .\Rules.psm1
```

    )

    $token | Where-Object Kind -eq 'LineContinuation' | ForEach-Object {
        [Microsoft.Windows.Powershell.ScriptAnalyzer.Generic.DiagnosticRecord]@{
            RuleName             = $myinvocation.InvocationName
            Message              = 'Do not use tick for line continuation'
            Extent               = $_.Extent
